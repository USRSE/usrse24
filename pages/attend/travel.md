## Conference Support Grants Program

With the sponsorship of various organizations such as the
[National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.org/) and the
[San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/) (SDSC),
US-RSE'24 is happy to provide dependent care financial support through
the Conference Support Grants Program.
The goal of this grant program is to increase the diversity of the
attendees of US-RSE’24 in regards to traditional (typically
under-represented groups in tech) as well as non-traditional
(e.g. domain background) diversity measures, and to enable
students to attend. Members of underrepresented groups as
well as students are often less-well funded making it more
difficult for them to attend conferences.

Eligibility for this program is determined by those who
identify with one or more of the following:

- Applicant identifies as an underrepresented group in research software engineering (BIPOC, female, etc.).
- Applicant is an undergraduate or graduate student currently enrolled at an academic institution;
- Applicant has demonstrated financial need in order to receive prioritization.

Grant program awardees will be covered for up to $500 to cover dependent
care costs. We can retract funding if
recipients do not adhere to the program rules.
As per the rules:

- The awardee must attend all conference sessions throughout its entire duration of 3 days. 
  - Exceptions will be made for students who are attending student events during regular sessions.
- The awardee must check in at the registration desk each day of the conference. 
- The awardees will be required to volunteer at the conference as per instructions issued later. 
- Grant program awardees must register for the conference by **September 16, 2024**.

**Deadlines**

- Application opens: August 12, 2024
- Submission deadline:  September 2, 2024
- Award Notification selection: September 6, 2024
