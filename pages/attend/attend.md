## COVID Policy

The conference organizers reserve the right to require attendees to wear masks
for the safety and health of all conference attendees. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that masks be worn indoors in public
areas when community COVID levels are high. In the month leading up to US-RSE’24,
conference organizers will monitor the community levels in New Mexico and
Bernalillo county ([website](https://covidactnow.org/us/new_mexico-nm/?s=48783624)).
At a minimum, a mask requirement will be implemented if either situation occurs:

- the community level reaches “High” in Bernalillo County anytime within 30 days prior to the conference
- the community level reaches “High” in New Mexico anytime within 15 days prior to the conference

If a mask requirement is put into effect, the following guidelines will be implemented.
Once in effect, **the requirement will not be removed, regardless of whether community
levels return to low**. While in official conference events or locations, **masks must
be worn at all times**, excluding those who have a documented medical reason and
during active eating and drinking. Repeat offenders may be asked to leave the
conference area. The conference will provide masks for those who do not have
them, and COVID tests will be available.

Presenters will not be required to wear masks during their presentations.

Anyone who is feeling ill is encouraged **NOT** to attend in person, even if you
are already in Albuquerque.

To report a medical exception or for any other questions,
please [email the organizers](mailto:usrse24-conference@us-rse.org).
