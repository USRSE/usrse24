Following the last technical session of the conference, we invite you to join us at the [Nuclear History Museum](https://www.nuclearmuseum.org) to explore the exhibit and socialize with your fellow attendees, courtesy of our generous sponsor [projectEureka! by Omnibond](https://omnibond.com/project-eureka/index.html). The museum exhibits are available for conference attendees between 6PM and 9PM. Food trucks will be available outside of the museum.

The Nuclear History Museum is a 501c3 non-profit museum, a Smithsonian Affiliate, and the nation's only congressionally chartered museum in its field. The museum is an intriguing place to learn the story of the Atomic Age, from early research and nuclear development to today's peaceful uses of nuclear technology.

Transportation will be provided for conference attendees who wish to attend the event. Shuttles will run between the Convention Center and the museum from 5:45 to 9PM.

Not going to the US-RSEâ€™24 but nearby? You are welcome to join us! This event is open to all Research Software Engineers and allies in the surrounding community and is completely free of charge.
