## Introduction

Dear Prospective US-RSE’24 Conference Sponsor,

We are delighted to invite you to join us for the second annual United States Research Software Engineer (US-RSE) Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, October 15-17, 2024! This year's theme is "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow".

The US-RSE Association is the leading professional community of research software engineering practitioners in the United States. The organization and its members are dedicated to creating research software that is fit for purpose, sustainable over the long-term and reliably developed and supported. Our members come from diverse backgrounds, but we share a common goal: to support and promote the role of research software and research software engineers in driving innovation and solving complex problems.

As a sponsor of the US-RSE Conference, you will have the opportunity to connect with a professional community and interact with talented expertise and leadership in the field of research software engineering. You will also support the advancement of critical research and development efforts across various disciplines and domains. In our 2023 conference, we hosted 250 attendees, selling out all available tickets, in addition to over a hundred virtual attendees for our online tutorials. We were proud to partner with a diverse array of 16 sponsors, ranging from corporations and academic institutions to national laboratories and small businesses. To view our 2023 sponsors, please visit this [page](https://us-rse.org/usrse23/).

In 2024 we are aiming bigger with a maximum capacity of 350 attendees across three full days. Topics of interest for this year’s conference include past or present research software engineering research and practice, research software engineering techniques, frameworks, libraries, research data management, reproducibility, and software sustainability. We will also explore diversity, equity, and inclusion issues in research software engineering, workforce development, and building a robust and sustainable RSE profession.

We hope you will consider joining us for this exciting event and supporting the US-RSE community. Sponsorship provides an opportunity to help this expanding field mature and provides a great way to connect your organization with in-demand professional talent. The attached prospectus describes sponsorship options and benefits.

Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

Conference General Chairs, Lauren Milechin | Miranda Mundt
US-RSE Association

* Provide useful swag, such as pens, pads of paper, flyers, and other items may be provided by a sponsor for no additional sponsorship fee and will be included in the conference bags.
* Host an off-site social event, independently or in conjunction with another sponsor. Our Local Logistics Chair can work with you to identify a suitable space and event type.
* For Platinum sponsors, your organization will have the chance to host a sponsored session or workshop during the conference for an additional fee, which will give you a platform to showcase your products, services, career opportunities, and thought leadership in front of a highly engaged and targeted audience.
