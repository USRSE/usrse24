## Research Software Engineers: where it started and where it’s going


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/SimonHettrick.jpg" alt="Simon Hettrick, SSI" style="float:right; padding:1em; width:350px">

The concept for Research Software Engineers came from a discussion at a workshop.
In only 12 years, it has grown into a career path and a self-sustaining movement
that has spanned the globe. In this talk, I will look at the history of the RSE
campaign and explain why I think the campaign was successful. I will move onto
what excites me most about today’s RSE community: the way in which it is helping
to change research culture from focussing not just on collecting results, but on
collecting reliable and reproducible results. The impetus for this change comes
from RSE’s contributions to the arguments around how we define “success” in research.
RSE has had a huge, positive impact on this debate by proving that if we don’t
recognise everyone who is vital to research, we limit our ability to conduct
research. I’ll end with some thoughts on tomorrow’s research and the inevitable
and hugely welcome growth of non-traditional research roles.


### Simon Hettrick

 Professor Simon Hettrick is Director of Strategy at the Software Sustainability
 Institute and a Director of the Southampton Research Software Group.

Simon is a passionate advocate for Research Software Engineers. He orchestrated a
campaign to gain recognition for this community, which grew from a handful of people
to an international community numbering in the tens of thousands. Presenting the
opening talk to a couple of hundred newly-minted RSEs at the first ever RSE
Conference in 2016 is his fondest memory from his entire career. He was the
founding chair of the UK's Association of Research Software Engineers and a
founding Trustee of the Society of Research Software Engineering.

He works with stakeholders from across the research community to develop policies
that support research software, the people who develop that software and the
researchers who rely on it. Simon's research focuses on the use of software
in the research community with the aim of understanding practices and demographics.
In this role, he conducted the first study of software reliance in academia.
 
Simon currently spends much of his time with the Hidden REF campaign. In this
role, he campaigns for a research culture that recognises all research outputs
and every role that makes research possible.

## US-RSE: Together We Grow Strong RSE Careers and a Thriving Community

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/SandraGesing.png" alt="Sandra Gesing, US-RSE and SDSC" style="float:left; padding:1em; width:350px">

In recent years, the scientific community has increasingly acknowledged the
essential contributions of Research Software Engineers (RSEs) to accelerating
scientific discovery. This recognition has led to significant advancements,
including the establishment of numerous RSE associations worldwide. While
these developments are encouraging, there remains the need for well-defined
career paths and incentives to fully support RSEs and their vital role in research.

To address this challenge, a multifaceted approach is crucial. This talk will
explore how the US-RSE community is working to meet RSEs, researchers, and
educators where they are, fostering a collaborative environment that supports
the growth of RSE careers and the development of a thriving RSE community.
We will discuss the critical role of RSEs in driving research and computational
activities, as well as the importance of advocating for a cultural shift that
values and recognizes the contributions of RSEs. We promote equity and belonging
within the RSE community to ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to
succeed. Looking ahead, we are committed to expand our collaborations and
strengthen partnerships with academic institutions, national laboratories,
industry and funding bodies to create new opportunities for RSEs.

By working together and growing our financial sustainability as an organization,
we can create a future where RSEs are valued and empowered to make a significant
impact on scientific research.


### Sandra Gesing

Sandra Gesing is the inaugural Executive Director of the US Research Software
Engineer Association (US-RSE) and a Senior Researcher at the San Diego Supercomputer
Center (SDSC). Her research focuses on science gateways, computational workflows
as well as distributed and parallel computing. She is especially interested
in sustainability of research software, usability of computational methods
and reproducibility of research results. Sustainability of research software
has many facets and she advocates for improving career paths for research
software engineers and for incentivizing their work via means beyond the
traditional academic rewarding system. Before her positions at US-RSE and
SDSC, she was a senior research scientist at the Discovery Partners Institute
(DPI), University of Illinois System, Chicago and she was an associate
research professor at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, US. Before
she moved to the US, she was a research associate at the University of
Edinburgh, UK, and at the University of Tübingen, Germany. Additionally, she
has perennial experience as a project manager and system developer in industry
in the US and Germany. As head of a system programmer group, she led long-term
software projects. She received her Master’s degree in computer science from
extramural studies at the FernUniversität Hagen, Germany, and her PhD in
computer science from the University of Tübingen, Germany. More details can be
