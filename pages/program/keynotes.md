## Research Software Engineers: where it started and where it’s going


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/SimonHettrick.jpg" alt="Simon Hettrick, SSI" style="float:right; padding:1em; width:350px">

The concept for Research Software Engineers came from a discussion at a workshop.
In only 12 years, it has grown into a career path and a self-sustaining movement
that has spanned the globe. In this talk, I will look at the history of the RSE
campaign and explain why I think the campaign was successful. I will move onto
what excites me most about today’s RSE community: the way in which it is helping
to change research culture from focussing not just on collecting results, but on
collecting reliable and reproducible results. The impetus for this change comes
from RSE’s contributions to the arguments around how we define “success” in research.
RSE has had a huge, positive impact on this debate by proving that if we don’t
recognise everyone who is vital to research, we limit our ability to conduct
research. I’ll end with some thoughts on tomorrow’s research and the inevitable
and hugely welcome growth of non-traditional research roles.


### Simon Hettrick

 Professor Simon Hettrick is Director of Strategy at the Software Sustainability
 Institute and a Director of the Southampton Research Software Group.

Simon is a passionate advocate for Research Software Engineers. He orchestrated a
campaign to gain recognition for this community, which grew from a handful of people
to an international community numbering in the tens of thousands. Presenting the
opening talk to a couple of hundred newly-minted RSEs at the first ever RSE
Conference in 2016 is his fondest memory from his entire career. He was the
founding chair of the UK's Association of Research Software Engineers and a
founding Trustee of the Society of Research Software Engineering.

He works with stakeholders from across the research community to develop policies
that support research software, the people who develop that software and the
researchers who rely on it. Simon's research focuses on the use of software
in the research community with the aim of understanding practices and demographics.
In this role, he conducted the first study of software reliance in academia.
 
Simon currently spends much of his time with the Hidden REF campaign. In this
role, he campaigns for a research culture that recognises all research outputs
and every role that makes research possible.
