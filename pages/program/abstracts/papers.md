## Enhancing the application of large language models with retrieval-augmented generation for a research community

_Juan José García Mesa, Gil Speyer_

The demand for efficient and innovative tools in research environments is ever-increasing in the rapidly
evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This paper explores the
implementation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the contextual accuracy and applicability of
large language models (LLMs) to meet the diverse needs of researchers. By integrating RAG, we address various
tasks such as synthesizing extensive questionnaire data, efficiently searching through document collections,
and extracting detailed information from multiple sources. Our implementation leverages open-source libraries,
a centralized repository of pre-trained models, and high-performance computing resources to provide
researchers with robust, private, and scalable solutions.

## Lab Dragon: An electronic Laboratory Notebook to Support Human Practices in Experimental Science

_Marcos Frenkel, Wolfgang Pfaff, Santiago Núñez-Corrales, Rob Kooper_

Lab notebooks are an integral part of science by documenting and tracking research progress in laboratories.
However, existing electronic solutions have not properly leveraged the full extent of capabilities provided by a
digital environment, resulting in most physics laboratory notebooks merely mimicking their physical counterparts
on a computer. To address this situation, we report here preliminary work toward a novel electronic laboratory
notebook, Lab Dragon, designed to empower researchers to create customized notebooks that optimize the benefits
of digital technology.

## An Empirical Survey of GitHub Repositories at Research Universities

_Samuel D. Schwartz, Boyana Norris, Stephen F. Fickas_

In this work we aim to partially answer the question, "Just how many research software projects are out there?”
by searching for open source GitHub projects affiliated with research universities in the United States. We
explore this through keyword searches on GitHub itself and by scraping university websites for links to GitHub
repositories. We then filter these results by using a large language model to classify GitHub repositories as
research software engineering projects or not, finding over 35,000 RSE repositories. We report our results by
university. We then analyze these repositories against metrics of popularity, such as stars and repository
forks, and find just under 14,000 RSE repositories meet our minimum criteria for projects which have a
community. Based on the time since a developer last pushed a change to a RSE repository with a community, we
further posit that 3,300 RSE repositories with communities and a link to a research university are at risk of
dying, and thus may benefit from sustainability support. Finally, across all RSE projects linked to a research
university, we empirically find the top repository languages are Python, C++, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Preferred Practices Through a Project Template

_Peter F. Peterson, Chen Zhang, Jose M. Borreguero-Calvo, Kevin A. Tactac_

In the realm of scientific software development, adherence to best practices is often advocated. However,
implementing these can be challenging due to differing opinions. Certain aspects, such as software licenses and
naming conventions, are typically left to the discretion of the development team. Our team has established a set
of preferred practices, informed by, but not limited to, widely accepted best practices. These preferred
practices are derived from our understanding of the specific contexts and user needs we cater to. To facilitate
the dissemination of these practices among our team and foster standardization with collaborating domain
scientists, we have created a project template for Python projects. This template serves as a platform for
discussing the implementation of various decisions. This paper will succinctly delineate the components that
constitute an effective project template and elucidate the advantages of consolidating preferred practices in
such a manner.
