The "Rapid Access Microtalks" (RAM) session is a dynamic and interactive opportunity for conference
attendees to share their ideas in a fast-paced format. This session encourages spontaneity
and creativity, offering participants a platform to present a 5-minute rapid-fire talk on
any topic of their choice. Whether you have a groundbreaking idea, a unique perspective,
or want to regale an abject project failure, this is your chance to shine!

### How It Works

- **Idea Submission:** From the start of the conference until Wednesday lunch, all attendees are invited to propose their microtalks. Simply head to Ballroom A and write down your idea on the designated poster board. Be sure to include the title of your talk, your name, and your email address.

- **Voting:** After lunch on Wednesday, the voting phase begins. Attendees can vote for their favorite proposed topics using the provided stickers. Each attendee is given **three** (3) votes to distribute as they see fit. Voting will continue through the beginning of the conference dinner on Wednesday.

- **Selection:** The votes will be tallied during the conference dinner, and the selected presenters will be notified by the end of the evening.

- **Microtalk Presentations:** The chosen speakers will present their 5-minute talks on Thursday morning from 10:30 AM to 12:00 PM in Ballroom A. This session promises to be an exciting and fast-paced showcase of diverse ideas and insights.

Donâ€™t miss this chance to contribute to the conference in a fun and engaging way! Submit your idea,
cast your votes, and join us for a morning of rapid access microtalks.
