## Birds of a Feather (BoFs)

Birds of a Feather sessions are expected to be informal, and ideally will include the audience’s participation. Sessions will last 90 minutes and take place in rooms that will accommodate approximately 100 people. Organizers may choose to submit with all presenters determined at the time of submission or include a plan for finding BoF presenters upon acceptance. Submission template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W86USaI0euZOuwPJoeZfZaX-qxG_OjRTM3brHNxNIvM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Workshops

Workshops will take place in person at the conference. They will be 180 minutes, not including  a 30-minute break in the middle. We will accept proposals for either Discussion Topics, similar to Birds of a Feather but with a longer time frame, or Learning Topics, which will be in-person teaching with hands-on exercises for attendees very similar to Tutorials, though delivered in-person.  Please note that you ***MAY*** submit similar proposals for both a tutorial and a Learning Topic workshop if you would like to deliver the same content online. Submission template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Wdb24neTDVoTQQ1XgpGOm7-OJNOtd30TnNEpZLY_Bo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Tutorials

Tutorials will take place ahead of the conference in a virtual format (to be recorded) from September 30th to October 11th. Infrastructure to register participants and allow the hosts to run the tutorial via Zoom will be provided. Tutorials may be either 90 minutes or two 90 minute sessions with a 30 minute break in the middle. Please note that you ***MAY*** submit similar proposals for both a tutorial and a Learning Topic workshop if you would like to deliver the same content in person at the conference. Submission template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RljR4M2kEBZx36JmSNLrw0iL7P-cx3aoosYdnHJR8t4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Papers

Papers will consist of submissions up to 10 pages in length, including figures, not counting references. Submissions should adhere to the IEEE format in US letter size as a PDF file, see [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Accepted paper submissions will additionally give an oral presentation at the conference, with 18 minutes for the speaker and 4 minutes for questions. Papers will be published via Zenodo after the conference’s completion. A special issue for papers is under consideration but no decision has yet been made.
